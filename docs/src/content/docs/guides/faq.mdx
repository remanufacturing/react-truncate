import { AppliesTo, RelatedIssues } from '@/components/AppliesTo'

## Why is the component not updated when only the container width changes?

<AppliesTo client:only="react" lang="en" />
<RelatedIssues client:only="react" lang="en" issues={[18]} />

Currently, the component has a built-in listener for the [Window: resize event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event) . When this event is triggered, the component recalculates its width and updates the displayed content.

However, in some cases, such as when using [react-resizable-panels](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels) , only the container element’s width changes while the browser window width remains the same. In these scenarios, the component will not automatically adjust its size.

### Reasons for not processing

To avoid unnecessary performance overhead, the component does not include a built-in [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) for parent elements. Therefore, when the container size changes without a window resize event, developers need to decide when to trigger a re-render to ensure the component responds correctly to layout adjustments.

### Recommended solution

Recommend to use a `key` to trigger re-truncate, nodes will re-render when a `key` is updated, this is [React's ability](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#resetting-state-with-a-key) .

#### Trigger via callback API

Set a variable and bind `key={refreshKey}` to the element that needs to respond to resize changes.

```tsx
const [refreshKey, setRefreshKey] = useState(Date.now())

// e.g. `<Truncate key={refreshKey} />`
```

When the element triggers a resize change, update this value.

```tsx
const onResize = () => setRefreshKey(Date.now())

// e.g. `<Panel onResize={onResize} />`
```

#### Trigger via dependency

If there is a State dependency that can trigger React.useEffect, you can also implement it this way, declaring a common Hook.

```ts
// e.g. src/hooks/use-refresh-key.ts
import { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from 'react'

export const useRefreshKey = (deps: unknown[]) => {
  const [refreshKey, setRefreshKey] = useState(Date.now())

  /**
   * Ensure dependencies are stable between renders. If deps is an array,
   * convert it to a string to prevent infinite loops.
   *
   * ⚠️ Note: `Array.prototype.toString()` is a shallow and order-sensitive
   * representation. It may not behave as expected for objects or nested arrays.
   * For more accurate results, consider using JSON.stringify() or a deep
   * comparison function like lodash.isEqual().
   */
  const effectDeps = useMemo(
    () => (Array.isArray(deps) ? deps.toString() : deps),
    [deps],
  )

  useEffect(() => {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      setRefreshKey(Date.now())
    })
  }, [effectDeps])

  return {
    refreshKey,
  }
}
```

Treat the related state as a dependency. When the dependency changes, the value of `refreshKey` will be automatically updated.

```tsx
const [width, setWidth] = useState(DEFAULT_WIDTH_VALUE)
const [lines, setLines] = useState(DEFAULT_LINES_VALUE)

const { refreshKey } = useRefreshKey([width, lines])

// e.g. `<Truncate key={refreshKey} />`
```
